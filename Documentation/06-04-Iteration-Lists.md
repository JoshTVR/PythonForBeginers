# for-in

Now you might be wondering, is there a way to iterate over a list? üîÅ

Yep, there are multiple ways to iterate over a list in Python! In this exercise, we are going to show you different ways to do so.

The first way is using a `for-in` loop. Here's an example:

```py
snowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]

for i in snowfall:
  print(i)
```

The `i` is a variable which represents an item inside the list, each time the loop iterates. This is saying for every item `in` the `snowfall` list, print out the item. The output will be:

```py
0.3
0.0
0.0
1.2
3.9
2.2
0.8
```

# for-in with range() and len()

We can also loop through a list using the index (position). To do so, we need the `range()` function and the `len()` function.

As a reminder:

- `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers, from 0 to a number.
- `len()` function returns the length of the list.

```py
snowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]

for i in range(len(snowfall)):
  print(snowfall[i])

```

The `i` here is an index. This is saying for every index from 0 to the length of `snowfall` minus 1 (7 - 1 = 6), print out the item at that index.

## Instructions

Back in the good ol' days, a mixtape is a compilation of music, a playlist, recorded onto a cassette tape or a CD.

Create a mixtape.py program and think of a theme for the songs.

Make a list called playlist and throw in some songs.

For example:

```py
# üíø Theme: Indie Travel Songs

playlist = [
'Porches - rangerover',
'Mount Eerie - You Swan, Go On',
'Carolyn Polachek - Look at Me Now',
'Pinegrove - Darkness',
'LVL UP - Spirit Was',
'Mitski - First Love / Late Spring'
]
```

Now loop over the list and print everything out! üìª

## Solved Exercise:

```py
# üíø Theme: Indie Travel Songs (Queue Snapshot)

playlist = [
    'MGMT - Little Dark Age',
    'Childish Gambino - Me and Your Mama',
    'Mann Friday, Gemma Griffiths - Leaving Lisbon',
    'Rihanna - Only Girl (In The World)',
    'East of Underground - I Love You',
    'Joji - YUKON (INTERLUDE)',
    'Dean Martin - Everybody Loves Somebody',
    'J Hus, Drake - Who Told You (feat. Drake)',
    'Village People - YMCA - Original Version 1978'
]

for i in range(len(playlist)):
  print(playlist[i])
```
