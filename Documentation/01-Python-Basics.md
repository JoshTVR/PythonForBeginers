# Process number one

### The first thing I've learned is how Python interacts with the user through the console.

I'd like to talk a little bit about it because I think it's one of the first "canon events" every developer experiences when starting with a new programming language.

```py
# Python Language :D
print('Hellow World!')
```

So that's that, and for now, this is sort of my first step in Python. If you press the "Run" button to make it shine, all you have to do is wait 1-2 seconds, and here you have it: you've made it! First canon event completed.

This should appear in the Terminal window if you did it correctly:

`Hello World`

You are now ready for the journey ahead. (ﾉ ◕ ヮ ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ ✧

Happy coding!
