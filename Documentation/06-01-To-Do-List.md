# Index

List items are changeable, meaning we can update individual items within a list.

But before we do that, how can we access an individual item within a list? Well, this is where index comes in!

An **index** is an item's position in a list.

Python is 0-indexed, meaning that the indices starts at 0:

```py
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
# Index:   0    1    2    3    4
```

- The item at index 0 is `'a'`.
- The item at index 1 is `'e'`.
- The item at index 2 is `'i'`.
- The item at index 3 is `'o'`.
- The item at index 4 is `'u'`.

To output each of the items, we can use the name[index] syntax:

```py
print(vowels[0])     # Output: a
print(vowels[1])     # Output: e
print(vowels[2])     # Output: i
print(vowels[3])     # Output: o
print(vowels[4])     # Output: u
```

# Negative Index

Another thing to note about index is that it can be positive or negative.

If the index is negative, it starts from -1 (which is the last item of a list) and it goes backwards from there.

```py
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
# Index:   0    1    2    3    4
# Index:  -5   -4   -3   -2   -1
```

- The item at index -5 is `'a'`.
- The item at index -4 is `'e'`.
- The item at index -3 is `'i'`.
- The item at index -2 is `'o'`.
- The item at index -1 is `'u'`.

# Slicing

Is there a way to get more than just one individual item? Yep! It's called slicing.

Slicing is where we can access certain parts of a sequence.

Instead of accessing an item using a single index like name`[index]`, we can get multiple items by specifying where to start and where to end the range like name`[start : end]`.

For example:

```py
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

print(vowels[0 : 3])
print(vowels[1 : 3])

# Output:

# ['a', 'e', 'i']

# ['e', 'i']
```

It starts from the start index (inclusive) and ends before the end index (non-inclusive). So in the above example, print(vowels[1 : 3]) only returned items at indices 1 and 2, and didn't include index 3.

# IndexError

There is a common error in Python when dealing with sequences called the IndexError. This is what happens when the index is out of the range of a list.

For example, when we try to do vowels[5], we will get something like:

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
    print(vowels[5])
IndexError: list index out of range
```

So make sure to be careful with that!

Instructions
Create a todo.py program that will define a todo list that contains the following items:

- '🏦 Get quarters.'
- '🧺 Do laundry.'
- '🌳 Take a walk.'
- '💈 Get a haircut.'
- '🍵 Make some tea.'
- '💻 Complete Lists chapter.'
- '💖 Call mom.'
- '📺 Watch My Hero Academia.'

Print the first item and the second item. What did you get?

Next, use slicing to print the third, fourth, and fifth items.

Try printing out the item at index 9 to see the IndexError before moving on.

## Solved Exercise:

```py
to_do_list = ['🏦 Get quarters.','🧺 Do laundry.','🌳 Take a walk.','💈 Get a haircut.','🍵 Make some tea.','💻 Complete Lists chapter.','💖 Call mom.','📺 Watch My Hero Academia.']
print(to_do_list[0:2])
```
