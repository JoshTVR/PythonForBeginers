# Data Types
"""
Variables
In programming, variables are used for storing data values. 
Each variable has a name and holds a value. üì¶
The variable name can consist of letters, numbers, and the _ underscore.

These are all valid variable names and values:

name = 'Erlich Bachman'
user_id = 16180339887
progress = 0.75
exp = 60
verified = True

The = equal sign means assignment:
We're assigning the string value 'Erlich Bachman' to the variable name.
We're assigning the number value 16180339887 to the variable user_id.
We're assigning the number value 0.75 to the variable progress.
We're assigning the number value 60 to the variable exp.
We're assigning the truth value True to the variable verified.

We can also change the value of a variable, or print it out:

xp = 70
xp = 80

print(xp)    # Output: 80

Data Types

Integer
An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains the number 0, positive and negative counting numbers. 
If we were counting the number of people on the bus or the number of jellybeans in a jar, we would use an integer.

year = 2023
age = 32

Float
A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractions or precise measurements. 
If you were measuring the length and width of the couch, calculating the test score percentage, 
or storing a baseball player‚Äôs batting average, we would use a float instead of an int.

pi = 3.14159
meal_cost = 12.99

String
A string, or str, is used for storing text. 
Strings are wrapped in double quotes " " or single quotes ' '.

message = "good nite"
username = '@snoopdogg'

Boolean
A Boolean data type, or bool, stores a value that can only be either true or false. In Python, it's capitalized True or False. 
It's named after the British mathematician George Boole (1815-1864).

late_to_class = False
cranky = True

"""
Operators

Computers are incredible at doing math calculations. 
Now that we have learned about variables, let's use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things! üî¢

Python has the following arithmetic operators:

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulo (returns the remainder)

score = 0           # score is 0
score = 4 + 3       # score is now 7
score = 4 - 3       # score is now 1
score = 4 * 3       # score is now 12
score = 4 / 3       # score is now 1.3333
score = 4 % 3       # score is now 1

print(score)        # Output: 1

And take a look at this code that calculates a 20% tip by calculating
the total and then multiplying by a float (decimal number):

pizza = 2.99
coke = 0.99

total = pizza + coke

tip = total * 0.2

print(tip) # Output: 0.796

Another way to write this is using parentheses to calculate the total and the tip in one line of code:

tip = (pizza + coke) * 0.2

Exponents
Python can also perform exponentiation such as 2¬≥ or 10¬≤.

In written math, we might see an exponent as a superscript number (like above), but typing superscripts isn't always easy on modern keyboards. Since exponentiation is super similar to multiplication, Python uses the notation **.

So 2 ** 3 is 2¬≥ and 10 ** 2 is 10¬≤.

Here are more examples:

score = 2 ** 2      # score is 4
score = 2 ** 3      # score is now 8
score = 2 ** 4      # score is now 16
score = 2 ** 5      # score is now 32

""""
User Input
Thus far, we've only been outputting things to the user, making our programs one-sided and not that fun. Almost every popular website, mobile app, or video game nowadays have both input and output.

So how do we get input from the user?

Python uses the input() function to get user input:

username = input('Enter your name: ')

print('Your name is: '+ 
      username)

The output will say "Enter your name: " and the user can type in something, 
hit enter, and whatever the user typed gets stored into the username variable.

So here, suppose the user typed in their name and pressed enter, 
it will output their name.


int()
By default, the user input is stored as a text string, which is okay for now.

But what about when we want to get a number from a user?

In that case, we would need to wrap an int() around the input() 
to convert the text string into a number:


age = int(input('What is your age? '))

print(age)

Now that the user types 24 and presses enter, the age variable 
will be an integer 24, not a text string "24".

Logical Operators
One more thing that we should learn is logical operators.

Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. 
They are and, or, and not operators:

and returns True if both conditions are True, and returns False otherwise.
or returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, and False otherwise.
not returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa.

Here are some examples:

if hunger > 4 and anger > 1:
  print('Hangry')
  
If the hunger variable is greater than 4 and the anger variable is greater than 1, 
then the program prints "Hangry".

if coffee > 0 or bubble_tea > 0:
  print('üòä')
  
If the coffee variable is greater than 0 or the bubble_tea variable is greater than 0, 
then the program prints a smiley face.

if not tired:
  print('Time to code!')
  
If the tired variable is not True, then the program prints "Time to code!"

So you might be wondering: and and or are awfully similar, 
how do I remember the differences between the two?

 Let's break this down in a table form:

A	B	A and B	A or B
False	False	False	False
False	True	False	True
True	False	False	True
True	True	True	True

# While Loop
Now that we got a sneak peek of a while loop, let's see what it does! üîÑ

A while loop looks very similar to an if statement. Just like an if statement, it executes the code if the condition is True.

However, the difference is that the while loop will continue to execute the code inside of it, over and over again, as long as the condition is True.

while condition:
  # code inside

In other words, instead of executing once if a condition is true, it executes again and again while that condition is true.

Here, we have a while loop that asks the user to guess a number:

guess = 0

while guess != 6:
  guess = int(input('Guess the number: '))

This will run over and over again until the user guesses the number 6:

Guess the number: 5
Guess the number: 3
Guess the number: 6

The variable guess starts at 0 on the first line and then the program enters the while loop:

It checks the condition: is it true that 0 doesn't equal 6? Yep. Okay, run the code inside.
It checks the condition again: is it true that 5 doesn't equal 6? Yep. Okay, run the code inside.
It checks the condition again: is it true that 3 doesn't equal 6? Yep. Okay, run the code inside.
It checks the condition again: is it true that 6 doesn't equal 6? Nope! So it exits the while loop and skips the code inside.
To reiterate (no pun intended), at the beginning of each "loop", the condition is checked. The moment the condition becomes false, the program exits the while loop and continues on from the line after it.

Note: If the condition is False from the get-go, then the code block wouldn't run at all and will be skipped.

On the left, you got all the single-digit numbers from 0 to 9. On the right are their squares. For example, in the last row, 9 √ó 9 = 81.

This can be done in Python using string concatenation:

# String concatenation

for i in range(5):
  print('The square of ' + str(i) + ' is ' + str(i*i))

The output would look like:

The square of 0 is 0
The square of 1 is 1
The square of 2 is 4
The square of 3 is 9
The square of 4 is 16

# String Interpolation
Let's learn a new tool that's very similar to string concatenation, before continuing on to the instructions.

String interpolation is a process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string.

For instance, if you have a template for saying hello to a person in an email like 'Hi {name}, nice to meet you!', you would like to replace the placeholder {name} with an actual name. This is string interpolation.

The above program can be recreated using string interpolation using the {} sign:

# String interpolation

for i in range(5):
  print(f'The square of {i} is {i*i}')

Notice the f prefix before the quotes.

"99 Bottles of Beer" is an old song that annoying kids, oops I mean everyone, sang on road trips to pass the time.

Create a 99_bottles.py program and use a for loop and a range() function to print out all the verses of "99 Bottles of Beer."

99 bottles of beer on the wall

99 bottles of beer

Take one down, pass it around

98 bottles of beer on the wall

And don't forget to use string interpolation!

Let's do a recap. ü•≥

The while loop iterates over and over again while the condition is true:

while coffee < 1:
  print('tired')

The for loop and the range() function to iterate for a certain number of times:

for i in range(10):
  print(i)

Fizz Buzz is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies. üêù

Though this challenge may appear simple to experienced coders, it is designed to weed out 90% of job 
candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively. 
Want to give it a try?

Create a fizz_buzz.py program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

Here's the catch:

For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
Here's the tricky part: For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
The output should look like:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

Btw, it's totally okay if you can't get this one...

Start by getting 1 to 100 printed out using a for loop and a range() function. Then, an if statement is needed.

A logical operator might also come in handy.

To find whether a number is the multiple of another number, the modulo operator % can be used. 
We briefly went over this operator in Exercise 7: Temperature. It returns the remainder of a division.

If a number num is a multiple of 3, it's num % 3 == 0, because the remainder is 0.

Checkpoint Project ‚õ≥Ô∏è
Congratulations on completing the first four chapters of The Legend of Python! Now let's use the skills you've learned (variables, control flow statements, and loops) to build a Python project on your own.

Use the Python Code Editor, Visual Studio Code, or your code editor of choice for this project.

# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic game that resonates with folks from around the world.

Create a rock_paper_scissors.py program where the user plays a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

The rules are as follows:

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
First, create a player and a computer variable.

Prompt the player to select number between 1 and 3 with input() and store it in player:

1 is for '‚úä' (Rock).
2 is for '‚úã' (Paper).
3 is for '‚úåÔ∏è' (Scissors).
Then, use the random.randint() method to assign a number to the computer variable (1 to 3).

Lastly, use control flow to compare the user's choice and the computer's choice, determine the winner, and print out who won.

The output should look something like this:

===================
Rock Paper Scissors
===================

1) ‚úä
2) ‚úã
3) ‚úåÔ∏è
Pick a number: 2

You chose: ‚úã
CPU chose: ‚úä
The player won!

# Bonus: Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
Okay, you have played Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you heard of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock? It's a fun variation of the classic game brought to popularity with a TV show called The Big Bang Theory.


The rules follow the classic ‚ÄúRock Paper Scissors‚Äù game, but with two new choices ‚Äì ‚ÄúLizard‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpock‚Äù:

Scissors cut Paper.
Paper covers Rock.
Rock crushes Lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock.
Spock smashes Scissors.
Scissors beat Lizard.
Lizard eats Paper.
Paper disproves Spock.
Spock vaporizes Rock.
Rock breaks Scissors.
Watch this video to understand it better.

Here's a note from the creator, Sam Kass:

‚ÄúI invented this game because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability. This version is also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives.‚Äù

Go back to your Rock Paper Scissors program and turn it into Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!

Use 'üññ' for "Spock" and 'ü¶é' for "Lizard".

The output should look something like this:

================================
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
================================

1) ‚úä
2) ‚úã
3) ‚úåÔ∏è
4) ü¶é
5) üññ
Pick a number: 3

You chose: ‚úåÔ∏è
CPU chose: ‚úåÔ∏è
It's a tie!
