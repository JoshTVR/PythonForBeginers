# Python is run one line at a time, from top to bottom.
# We can output multiple messages by using multiple print() functions. 
# For example, if we want to print out two simple greetings:
"""
print('🌻 Morning Dharma!')
print('🙋🏽 Evening Sonny!')

# This will output:

🌻 Morning Dharma!
🙋🏽 Evening Sonny!
"""
# Suppose we want the output to look exactly like this pattern below:
"""
       1
     2 3
   4 5 6
7 8 9 10
"""

# We can achieve this by using the print() function with the appropriate formatting.
# The following code will print the desired pattern:

print('       1')
print('     2 3')
print('   4 5 6')
print('7 8 9 10')


# The output of this example program would be:
"""
       1
     2 3
   4 5 6
7 8 9 10
"""
