"""
Comments are very important in programming because they are used to document what our code does. 
They are also used to disable parts of the program.

When the program is run, the comments are ignored.

In Python, we can create a comment using the # hashtag symbol:
"""
# to declare a # in Python, you can use the escape character (\) before the # symbol
# for example, to declare a # in a string, you can use the following syntax: 
# my_string = 'This is a # symbol'
# or you can use double quotes:
# my_string = "This is a # symbol"
# or you can use triple quotes:
# my_string = '''This is a # symbol'''

# print('Hi')   # I'm a comment, too!


print('JJJJJJJJJJJ')
print('     J     ')
print('     J     ')
print('     J     ')
print('JJJJJJ     ')
