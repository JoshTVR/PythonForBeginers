Logical Operators
One more thing that we should learn is logical operators.

Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. 
They are and, or, and not operators:

and returns True if both conditions are True, and returns False otherwise.
or returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, and False otherwise.
not returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa.

Here are some examples:

if hunger > 4 and anger > 1:
  print('Hangry')
  
If the hunger variable is greater than 4 and the anger variable is greater than 1, 
then the program prints "Hangry".

if coffee > 0 or bubble_tea > 0:
  print('😊')
  
If the coffee variable is greater than 0 or the bubble_tea variable is greater than 0, 
then the program prints a smiley face.

if not tired:
  print('Time to code!')
  
If the tired variable is not True, then the program prints "Time to code!"

So you might be wondering: and and or are awfully similar, 
how do I remember the differences between the two?

 Let's break this down in a table form:

A	B	A and B	A or B
False	False	False	False
False	True	False	True
True	False	False	True
True	True	True	True

Instructions

Since 1927, "The Cyclone" roller coaster has delighted visitors at Coney Island (Brooklyn, NY). 🎢

They're now installing a new entry system (the height requirement is 137 cm and the cost is 10 credits) and need your help writing the program for it!

Create a new file called the_cyclone.py.

Ask the user what their height is and how many credits they have, and store the values in a height variable and a credits variable.

Use a combination of relational and logical operators to create the rules:

If they are tall enough and have enough credits, print "Enjoy the ride!"
Else if they have enough credits, but they aren't tall enough, print "You are not tall enough to ride."
Else if they are tall enough, but they don't have enough credits, print "You don't have enough credits."
Else, print a message saying they have not met either requirement.
"""


height = int(input('What is your height in cm??'))
credits = int(input('How many credits do you have??'))

if height < 137 and credits < 10:
  print('Your height and credits are insufficient')
elif height > 137  and credits < 10:
  print('You don\'t have enough credits.')
elif height < 137 and credits > 10:
  print('You are not tall enough to ride.')
else:
  print('Enjoy the ride!')
