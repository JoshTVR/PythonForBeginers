"""
Create a grades.py program that checks whether a grade is above or below 55.

Start by creating a variable called grade and give it a value between 0-100.

Write a if/else statement for the following:

If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed."
Else, print "You failed."
After you run the code, change grade's value and rerun it. 
Do this a few times to make sure it's working as intended.

grade = int(input('What is the grade temperature?? '))

if grade >= 55:
  print("You passed.")
else:
  print("You failed.")
