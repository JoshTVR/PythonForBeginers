In Python, we can create a comment using the # hashtag symbol:
"""
# to declare a # in Python, you can use the escape character (\) before the # symbol
# for example, to declare a # in a string, you can use the following syntax:

# Data Types
"""
Variables
In programming, variables are used for storing data values. 
Each variable has a name and holds a value. üì¶
The variable name can consist of letters, numbers, and the _ underscore.

These are all valid variable names and values:

name = 'Erlich Bachman'
user_id = 16180339887
progress = 0.75
exp = 60
verified = True

The = equal sign means assignment:
We're assigning the string value 'Erlich Bachman' to the variable name.
We're assigning the number value 16180339887 to the variable user_id.
We're assigning the number value 0.75 to the variable progress.
We're assigning the number value 60 to the variable exp.
We're assigning the truth value True to the variable verified.

We can also change the value of a variable, or print it out:

xp = 70
xp = 80

print(xp)    # Output: 80

Data Types

Integer
An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains the number 0, positive and negative counting numbers. 
If we were counting the number of people on the bus or the number of jellybeans in a jar, we would use an integer.

year = 2023
age = 32

Float
A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractions or precise measurements. 
If you were measuring the length and width of the couch, calculating the test score percentage, 
or storing a baseball player‚Äôs batting average, we would use a float instead of an int.

pi = 3.14159
meal_cost = 12.99

String
A string, or str, is used for storing text. 
Strings are wrapped in double quotes " " or single quotes ' '.

message = "good nite"
username = '@snoopdogg'

Boolean
A Boolean data type, or bool, stores a value that can only be either true or false. In Python, it's capitalized True or False. 
It's named after the British mathematician George Boole (1815-1864).

late_to_class = False
cranky = True
"""

"""
Operators

Computers are incredible at doing math calculations. 
Now that we have learned about variables, let's use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things! üî¢

Python has the following arithmetic operators:

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulo (returns the remainder)

score = 0           # score is 0
score = 4 + 3       # score is now 7
score = 4 - 3       # score is now 1
score = 4 * 3       # score is now 12
score = 4 / 3       # score is now 1.3333
score = 4 % 3       # score is now 1

print(score)        # Output: 1

And take a look at this code that calculates a 20% tip by calculating
the total and then multiplying by a float (decimal number):

pizza = 2.99
coke = 0.99

total = pizza + coke

tip = total * 0.2

print(tip) # Output: 0.796

Another way to write this is using parentheses to calculate the total and the tip in one line of code:

tip = (pizza + coke) * 0.2

"""
F = -459.67  # Fahrenheit temperature
C = (F - 32) * 5/9

"""
Exponents
Python can also perform exponentiation such as 2¬≥ or 10¬≤.

In written math, we might see an exponent as a superscript number (like above), but typing superscripts isn't always easy on modern keyboards. Since exponentiation is super similar to multiplication, Python uses the notation **.

So 2 ** 3 is 2¬≥ and 10 ** 2 is 10¬≤.

Here are more examples:

score = 2 ** 2      # score is 4
score = 2 ** 3      # score is now 8
score = 2 ** 4      # score is now 16
score = 2 ** 5      # score is now 32

""""
User Input
Thus far, we've only been outputting things to the user, making our programs one-sided and not that fun. Almost every popular website, mobile app, or video game nowadays have both input and output.

So how do we get input from the user?

Python uses the input() function to get user input:

username = input('Enter your name: ')

print('Your name is: '+ 
      username)

The output will say "Enter your name: " and the user can type in something, 
hit enter, and whatever the user typed gets stored into the username variable.

So here, suppose the user typed in their name and pressed enter, 
it will output their name.


int()
By default, the user input is stored as a text string, which is okay for now.

But what about when we want to get a number from a user?

In that case, we would need to wrap an int() around the input() 
to convert the text string into a number:


age = int(input('What is your age? '))

print(age)

Now that the user types 24 and presses enter, the age variable 
will be an integer 24, not a text string "24".

Random

In Python, modules are .py files containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python program.

But first, let's import this module so we can use its functions.


import random

Next, we'll create a variable to store the randomly generated value. Declare a variable called num, 
and assign it to the function call:

num = random.randint(1, 9)

This will generate a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive of both).

Together, the code will look like:

import random

num = random.randint(1, 9)

print(num)

Logical Operators
One more thing that we should learn is logical operators.

Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. 
They are and, or, and not operators:

and returns True if both conditions are True, and returns False otherwise.
or returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, and False otherwise.
not returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa.

Here are some examples:

if hunger > 4 and anger > 1:
  print('Hangry')
  
If the hunger variable is greater than 4 and the anger variable is greater than 1, 
then the program prints "Hangry".

if coffee > 0 or bubble_tea > 0:
  print('üòä')
  
If the coffee variable is greater than 0 or the bubble_tea variable is greater than 0, 
then the program prints a smiley face.

if not tired:
  print('Time to code!')
  
If the tired variable is not True, then the program prints "Time to code!"

So you might be wondering: and and or are awfully similar, 
how do I remember the differences between the two?

 Let's break this down in a table form:

A	B	A and B	A or B
False	False	False	False
False	True	False	True
True	False	False	True
True	True	True	True
