# how do i comment in Python?
# comments are preceded by a hash (#) symbol
# comments are ignored by the Python interpreter
# comments are useful for explaining code and making it more readable
# comments can be single-line or multi-line
# single-line comments start with a # symbol
# multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes (''' or """)
# multi-line comments can span multiple lines
# multi-line comments are useful for documenting code and providing detailed explanations about the code
# multi-line comments are ignored by the Python interpreter

# how do i declare a # in Python?
# to declare a # in Python, you can use the escape character (\) before the # symbol
# for example, to declare a # in a string, you can use the following syntax: 
# my_string = 'This is a # symbol'
# or you can use double quotes:
# my_string = "This is a # symbol"
# or you can use triple quotes:
# my_string = '''This is a # symbol'''
